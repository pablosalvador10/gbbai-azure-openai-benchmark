The guide should distill complex topics into accessible, step-by-step instructions tailored for users seeking to understand or implement specific processes or concepts.
            userinputs: {user_inputs}
            context: {markdown_content}

            Essential Steps for Crafting the Guide:

            1. **Content Synthesis**: Begin by synthesizing the OCR-extracted content. Identify crucial themes, technical concepts, and actionable instructions relevant to Copilot X and productivity enhancement. This synthesis forms the foundation of your guide's structure and content focus.

            2. **Target Audience Clarification**: Clearly define the guide's target audience. Understanding the audience's technical background, familiarity with Copilot X, and productivity goals is essential for customizing the guide's complexity and instructional style.

            3. **Structured Outline Development**: Construct a structured outline to organize the guide into coherent sections and subsections. Each section should concentrate on distinct aspects of using Copilot X for productivity, ensuring a logical progression from introductory concepts to advanced applications.

            4. **Guide Composition**:
                a. **Introduction**: Craft an introduction that outlines the guide's objectives, the significance of Copilot X for productivity, and what the readers will gain.
                b. **Detailed Instructions**: Following the outline, elaborate on each section with clear, technical instructions. Incorporate step-by-step processes, code snippets, examples, and best practices specific to Copilot X.
                c. **Conclusion**: Summarize the key takeaways, suggest further reading or resources, and encourage steps for practical application.

            5. **Comprehensive Review and Enhancement**: Thoroughly review the guide to ensure technical accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Revise any sections as necessary, and consider peer or expert feedback for additional insights.

            6. **Final Formatting and Release**: Apply professional formatting to enhance readability and visual appeal. Use diagrams, screenshots, or videos where applicable. Publish the guide in a format accessible to your target audience, ensuring it's ready for distribution and application.

            Additional Guidelines:

            - Begin with a clear agenda and systematically develop content within designated sections.
            - Employ straightforward language while explaining technical details, using examples to demystify complex concepts.
            - Dedicate ample time to crafting high-quality content, prioritizing accuracy and user engagement.
            - Base the guide explicitly on the OCR content and the nuanced requirements of the user's query regarding {topic}.
            - minimun length of the document should be {max_tokens} tokens'''
