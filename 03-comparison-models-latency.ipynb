    "## Latency with Streaming Option\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's  the streaming option provided by the Azure OpenAI Chat API. Streaming allows us to process data in chunks as it becomes available, which can be beneficial in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros of Streaming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming processes large files or data in smaller chunks, reducing memory requirement.\n",
    "- **Real-Time Processing**: It enables real-time processing and progress monitoring, which can be useful for live data feeds or providing users with real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons of Streaming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased Code Complexity**: Streaming can increase code complexity as you need to handle data in chunks and manage the state between chunks.\n",
    "- **Potential Slowdown**: It might slow down processing as the code waits for data to become available.\n",
    "- **Inconsistency in Latency**: Inconsistency in latency can be a challenge, especially if the first response takes a long time due to a complex prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test with Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Azure OpenAI Chat API, the `stream` parameter in the `client.chat.completions.create()` method determines whether to stream back partial progress. If set to `True`, tokens are sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the streaming process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A chat completion call is made with `stream=True`.\n",
    "2. The async iterable response starts receiving chunks of data from the server.\n",
    "3. For each chunk received, the code enters the `async for` loop.\n",
    "4. The chunk of data is converted to JSON and checked if it contains any choices (responses from the model).\n",
    "5. If there are responses, the content of the response is printed to the console.\n",
    "6. This process repeats until all chunks of data have been received and processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the responses from the model are printed as soon as they are received, instead of waiting for the entire output to be ready. This is the concept of streaming in the context of this code."

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the non-streaming option provided by the Azure OpenAI Chat API. In a non-streaming option, the model generates its entire output in one go and then sends it back to the user. This is in contrast to the streaming option, where the model sends back portions of its output as soon as they are generated, even while the rest of the output is still being generated. The non-streaming option is the default in the Azure OpenAI Python SDK.\n",

    "The code below tests the latency of various models of Azure OpenAI under different conditions. Here are some technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The script uses environment variables to securely access the API key and endpoint needed for Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "- It initializes the AzureOpenAI client with the necessary API key, API version, and endpoint.\n",
    "- It sets up a list of model deployment names and maximum token sizes to be tested. The models represent different versions of the AI and token sizes define the maximum length of the generated output.\n",
    "- Two time intervals are defined: one for tests with the same model but different token sizes, and another for tests with different models. This is done to prevent rapid, successive calls which could lead to skewed results due to potential caching or rate limiting.\n",
    "- It defines an asynchronous function `make_call()` to send requests to the OpenAI service and measure the response time. This function utilizes the `chat.completions.create()` method of the OpenAI client to generate a message from the model.\n",
    "- The function prints the time of sending the request, the model's response, and the time taken for the model to generate the response.\n",
    "- Finally, it iterates over each model and token size, making calls to the OpenAI service and measuring the response time. The script pauses between tests as per the defined intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This non-streaming test allows for a comprehensive latency analysis of different AI models under varying output lengths, aiding in the selection of the most suitable model for specific use cases."
